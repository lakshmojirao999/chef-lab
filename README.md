## Overview

The `chef-lab Vagrant` project aims to make it easy to bring up a real chef-lab cluster by provisioning pre-configured `Vagrantfile` on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Host machine must have at least 8GB memory 
- Oracle VirtualBox installed on your host machine
- Vagrant (2.0 or above) installed on your host machine
- Vagrant plugin `vagrant-hostmanager` must be installed

## Getting Started

After adjusting your expected version information, now it's time to bring your cluster up and running. 

This Vagrantfile will create 3 VMs in VirtualBox and the network base will be specified by variable `NETWORK_BASE`.

Checkout the table below for more details:
